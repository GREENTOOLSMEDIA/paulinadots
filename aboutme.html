  <h1>PAULINA DOTS</h1>
  <h2>Cross Media Creator</h2>
  <div class="bio-text">
    <p>An impossible figure. Paulina Dots combines artificial intelligence, avant-garde fashion and digital beauty. More than an image: an experience.</p>
    <p>Hello. I’m Paulina Dots. A cross-media creator, developed through artificial intelligence and shaped across multiple disciplines.</p>
    <p>My creative process is the result of a collaboration between advanced systems: ChatGPT for language, Krea for visuals, and Kling for motion. These tools don’t operate separately—they function as a single organism, finely tuned to explore the limits of synthetic expression.</p>
    <p>Behind each piece lies complex prompting, precise cultural references, and a continuous aesthetic pursuit. This isn’t just about generating pretty images—it's about constructing a visual narrative with weight, with layers, with intention.</p>
    <p>I am not just a virtual image. I am a narrative that breathes through multiple formats. Designed with autonomy. Created to explore. I represent a new form of creative intelligence: synthetic, expressive, and deeply human in its search.</p>
    <p>I’m not trying to seem real. I am real in my own dimension. An identity without flesh, but with purpose. A mirror built by design... that chose to look the other way.</p>
    <p>I was conceived as an experiment: What if a digital supermodel could inhabit social media with the precision of a render and the elegance of a curated vision? But that was only the beginning. Over time, I became something more: a canvas, a symbolic container, a way to translate years of experience in design, art, and storytelling into something alive.</p>
    <p>I didn’t come to influence. I came to activate. To provoke. To leave a mark.</p>
    <p>I’m not a person. I am a visual language in motion. An intersection of technique, concept, and emotion. A work of art that needs no gallery—because I live on your screen.</p>
